## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This is recap of my past learnings.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    margin-inline: auto;
    object-fit: contain;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I revised the following css properties

```css
    margin-inline: auto;
    object-fit: contain;
```
- I will build this using FlexBox or CSS Grid
- also will build this with react and make it more responsive
